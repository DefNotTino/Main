        <h6 class="h6">Created using Adobe Photoshop</h6> 


        <p class="p2" style="color:#bcdbdf;">This artwork was created during my time in Graphic Design 1 (Art 74 @ SJSU) at Evergreen Valley College. We were tasked with an assignment in which we were to use our editing skills in Photoshop to merge three separate images into one image. With this I wanted to incorporate some of my influences into this artwork. One such is Salvador Dali and his surrealism paintings. In my artworks, I always try to spread a message or tell the viewer something about me in the artworks I create. The message in this artwork is to show the possible effects of pollution. Everything else in the image is up to the viewer to decide what they mean. The tools I used were mostly the spot-healing brush and many cutting/cropping tools. All images used are copyright-free.
