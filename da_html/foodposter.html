        <h6 class="h6">Created using Adobe Illustrator</h6> 


        <p class="p2" style="color:#bcdbdf;">During my time at Evergreen Valley College (Graphic Design I / Art 74), our final project was to create a poster for the school. Specifically, we were asked by the school to create a poster for their upcoming food drive asking for food donations for families in need. The catch for this assignment was to choose from an art style between Art Deco and Art Nouveau. I decided to go with Art Deco because I enjoyed their art style more than Art Nouveau. To create this replication of the arts tyle, I had to find a font that resonated with the theme. I choose to go with gradients and bright colors. The important thing also is color choice. I decided to go with green as the color theme as it represents hope, renewal and freshness. Its also the color of most vegetables which was most of the food being donated at the time. The image I imagined in my head as a concept was a hand offering the food. I achieved this by tracing out an image of my hands as a reference and coloring it in with gradients. The fruits were modified eclipses with the 3D blend tool.
