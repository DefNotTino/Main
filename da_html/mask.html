        <h6 class="h6">Created using Procreate and Adobe Photoshop</h6> 


        <p class="p2" style="color:#bcdbdf;">During my time in Art 3 at SJSU, we had a final project where we had to compare two different art styles and mediums but have the same general theme. The theme I chose was spreading awareness about wearing masks in public during the 2021 COVID pandemic. This was during the time of the lockdowns being heavy in Santa Clara, CA. I was under alot of pressure since it was my first semester at SJSU, yet it was my first time having classes online. The pressure of the lockdown was weighing heavily on me, and I wanted to remind people of how we can end this pandemic as soon as possible. One such method is by wearing masks in public. The theme and colors are inspired from the Art Deco movement, which is also seen in my Food Poster image. The font was created in Adobe Photoshop while everything else was created in Procreate.
