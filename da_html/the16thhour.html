        <h6 class="h6">Created using Processing 3.4 and 4.1</h6> 


        <p class="p2" style="color:#bcdbdf;">This project was created during my time at Art 101 (SJSU). It was created using a computer program named, Processing. As our class learned more about Processing, we started diving into the advanced techniques, which are listed below. This project was the hardest project in the semester because of the Class function and its complications in the coding. The title comes from the song I was listening too while I was working on this and the amount of time it took to finally understand the concept of Class functions. The song is, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHWXx27VKMI"><i>The 16th Hour</i></a>, by Deadmau5. The project itself uses a combination of the Bezier Curve and the Noise Wave function. The curves are creating a abstract shape plotted on a line and is being rotated on the X and Y axis of the camera. The color choice is inspired from blood for the theme of Halloween. I am really proud of the results and hope you enjoy it as much as I did!
