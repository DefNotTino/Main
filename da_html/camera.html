        <h2 class="h2" style="color:#a393eb">Camera (2018)</h2>

        
        <h6 class="h6">Created using Adobe Illustrator</h6> 


        <p class="p2" style="color:#bcdbdf;">During my time at EVC (Graphic Design I / Art 74), we had an assignment which required the students to learn how to design a device featuring its components or attachments and how they attach to the device. My interpretation of the assignment was to take a film camera, film and the lens cap. The arrows designate where the item is supposed to attach to on the device. This was all purely designed in Adobe Illustrator using the pen and line tools. In the design, I had a tough time trying to replicate the back of the camera, but my intention with most of my art is to be as detailed and faithful to the subject material as possible. Out of all the assignments I created during that class, this was the most tedious due to the amount of effort, time, and detail I put into it. However, I am very much proud of the result.
